--> React is a Library

--> Framework is like Military and Library is like Cool Dude

--> Framework is Really strict how the file name should be, the Naming Convention, Folder Structure

--> BAAS Apps Backend as a service i.e:- Social Media Apps, Ecommerce Apps

--> Class based Components are Legacy based codes

--> React is not a complete solution in most of the cases
