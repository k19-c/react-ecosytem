/*

--> React is a Library

--> Framework is like Military and Library is like Cool Dude

--> Framework is Really strict how the file name should be, the Naming Convention, Folder Structure

--> BAAS Apps Backend as a service i.e:- Social Media Apps, Ecommerce Apps

--> Class based Components are Legacy based codes

--> React is not a complete solution in most of the cases

--> No SEO, Browser Render of JS , No Routing .

--> Framework:- Gatsby, Remix, Next Js you can prefer on top of React


*/  /* 
 
* Scripts 

--> you can see there are lot of files which got Injected when inspect the browser and see in the Header part

--> React-scripts will do the behind screen magic . while running the Application or building the Application .

--> since the Application is run by react-scripts It Automatically finds the index.html and InJects the Javascript file.

-->  there is a Browser DOM and React DOM known as a Virtual DOM

--> It tries to mimick the Original DOM and whatever the updates we make it first goes into the virtual DOM

--> Any updates happen in the Virtual DOM are pushed in to the Real DOM
