# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

# Tailwind  Configuration with Vite + react

--> npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer .

--> npx tailwindcss init -p .

--> In index.css we have to have 3 files

1). @tailwind base;
2). @tailwind components;
3). @tailwind utilities;


--> we need to add  content: [ "./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",], in the tailwind.config.js file
